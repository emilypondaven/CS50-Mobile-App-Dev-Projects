JAVASCRIPT NOTES
- Javascirpt is a single-threaded, synchronous language

Types:
- String    - Number
- Null      - Undefined
- Object    - Symbol
- Boolean

Coercion: one type to another
Scope: how long a method lives for

Transpiler: 
- takes newer features and turns it into earlier code
- makes newer features compatible with previous versions

First-class functions
- can be assigned to variables/passed into functions

Higher-order functions
- map(), filter(), reduce() - passes in functions

Immediately-invoked function expression
EXAMPLE - we have an object with an inc and get function
const counter = (function() {
    let count = 0   // not accessible globally

    return {
        inc: function() { count = count + 1 }
        get: function() { console.log(count) }
    }
})()

counter.inc()
counter.get()
counter.get()


EXECUTION STACK
- functions added to a stack
